    "The first chapter, "The Generation of the ECG", reviews the electrophysiology of the heart and then considers how the electrical signals, generated as the cardiac fibers sequentially depolarize and then repolarize, are transformed into the waveform recorded from the body surface by electrodes placed on the limbs and the chest.<br>

The various types and locations of these electrodes are discussed and the concept that the ECG represents the uncanceled or resultant electrical forces generated as the heart undergoes its sequential depolarization and repolarization is stressed."

    "The heart lies largely, but not entirely, to the left of the midline in the anterior mediastinum. It is somewhat trapezoidal. The right border is more or less vertical, the diaphragmatic border more or less horizontal and the left border more or less diagonal, extending on a line from the right shoulder to the spleen.",
    "Although the cardiac chambers are labeled as right or left sided, they could equally as well be labeled as anterior and posterior. The right-sided venous chambers are anterior to the left-sided systemic chambers.",
    "The right border of the heart is comprised almost entirely of the right atrium. The left border is made up of the left atrial appendage which occupies the upper third and the left ventricle.",
    "The anterior surface is almost entirely the right ventricle and main pulmonary artery, while the posterior surface is comprised of the left atrium and ventricle.",
